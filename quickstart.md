# Quickstart

Before you get started, you must invite `Devico` to your own Discord server.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a class="button" style="font-size: 2.05rem;" href="hhttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=936165836010426369&permissions=8&scope=bot">Devico Invite </a>
</div>

?> You must be a server Administrator to do this.

## Get Normal Messages

With _two_ simple steps, you can record your own audio:

1. Join a voice channel, then type `!record`
1. Create and upload recording, type `!save`

!> If you `!stop` before `!save`, the recording will be **DELETED**!

## Save Recording

The recording will either:

* Be uploaded directly to Discord where you can keep it _forever_
* Or, you'll be given a link where you can download your recording within **24 hours**

!> If you forget to download the recording before then, there's nothing I can do to restore the recording. It is gone.
